# Weather App and Testing Suite

This repository contains a simple weather application and a set of Cypress tests designed to verify its functionality. The weather application allows users to search for weather information for various cities.

## Weather App

### Getting Started
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.

2. Open the `index.html` file to run the weather application in your web browser.

3. Enter the name of a city in the search bar and press 'Enter' to retrieve weather information.

### Application Features
- The application provides weather information such as humidity, wind speed, and a brief description for the entered city.

- The application also displays a background image based on the city's location.

## Tests

### Running the Tests

2. Clone this repository if you haven't already.

3. Open your terminal and navigate to the repository's root directory.

4. Run the Cypress tests by executing the following command:




5. In the Cypress Test Runner, select a test file (e.g., `search.spec.js`) to run the tests.

### Custom Cypress Command

To simplify the selection of elements with data attributes for testing, we have created a custom Cypress command called `getDataTest`. This command allows you to select elements using their `data-test` attribute.

Here is the custom command:
```javascript
Cypress.Commands.add('getDataTest', (dataTestSelector) => {
return cy.get(`[data-test="${dataTestSelector}`);
});
